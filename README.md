# Dynamic-Dashboard

The dataset pertains to an imaginary chocolate enterprise named "Awesome Chocolate," encompassing 4000 data entries. The objective is to showcase a business overview, inclusive of aggregate sales, profits, and box count. Additionally, the top 5 products are highlighted, along with graphical representation for monthly sales, box count, and profits.

The dataset consists of three primary categories: Bites, Bars, and Other. Each category features distinct chocolate products. To facilitate data analysis, two slicers have been implemented for a singular table. The data extraction is executed via a Pivot Table, enabling the incorporation of dynamic titles for each category.
